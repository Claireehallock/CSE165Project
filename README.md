# CSE165Project
This is a Project for my CSE 165 class. I created it using Qt and OpenGL. To run it, the user needs to install the Qt Creator IDE
These instructions can be followed: https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/resources/qt/install-windows

Note: This uses Qt Creator, not Qt Design.

After this, the user should download the project, open it using Qt Creator, then run the project using CTRL + R.
